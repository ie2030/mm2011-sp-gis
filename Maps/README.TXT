This is simple WPF Application that can use Google Maps API. 
It can draw map, show us a coordinats of one marker and search places by name.

GoogleMapsFlashInWpf is main application. It needs AxInterop.ShockwaveFlashObjects.dll, Interop.ShockwaveFlashObjects.dll (FlashAxLib) and GoogleMaps.swf (FlashModule). Source code is included.

All work is made by Trechekas Ivan and team (sorry, I don't know names), I have just rewrite GoogleMaps.swf
