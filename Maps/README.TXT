This is a simple WPF Application that can use Google Maps API.
It can draw map, show us a coordinats of one marker and search places by name.

GoogleMapsFlashInWpf is a main application. It needs a AxInterop.ShockwaveFlashObjects.dll, Interop.ShockwaveFlashObjects.dll (FlashAxLib) and GoogleMaps.swf (FlashModule). Source code is included.

All work made by Trechekas Ivan and team(sorry, don't know names), I just rewrite GoogleMaps.swf
